					<br /><br />
					Fubb is the best way to keep track of your Movie Collection. 
					<br /><br />
					- Show off your movie collection<br />
					- See what other people are watching. <br />
					- Rate and review the films that you Love! <br />
				</p>
				<p class='basic_font'>
					<span class='sub_title_font'>How does it Work?</span>
					<br /><br />
					After creating an account on Fubb, you can start adding Movies to your collection. When you add a movie, our army of Tiny Robots Ravage through various parts of the internet in search of data for that movie. 
					<br /><br />
					When the robots return home with the datas, your movie will have it's own page: with a movie trailer, theatrical poster, movie stats, and more! You can now relax, kick back with a beer, and surf through your consolidated collection, in any way that you see fit.

					<br /><br />

					Special Thanks to my darling Natalie, whose movie collection and penchant for finding films was so omnivorous and radical, that I had to program for 3 months just to be able to handle it.
